                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Relevance: Somewhat Relevant

2) Justification: The study demonstrates context-specific regulatory effects (reQTLs) in stimulated immune cells and uses colocalization to connect these regulatory variants to disease GWAS loci, revealing disease effector genes not captured in GTEx. While it advances understanding of regulatory mechanisms beyond baseline tissues, it does not involve large-scale UK Biobank/Wide GWAS, multi-omics QTLs beyond eQTLs, 3D genome perturbations, or AI-driven therapeutic targeting.

3) Which parts connect to your research:
- Context-specific eQTL mapping (stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages) aligns with your interest in context-dependent regulatory variation driving disease.
- Colocalization of reQTLs with disease GWAS loci to nominate disease effector genes.
- Identification of disease-associated genes not found in GTEx, highlighting tissue/condition-specific regulatory architecture.
- Emphasis on linking regulatory variants to disease risk, relevant to your multi-omics QTL integration and regulatory element-to-disease mappings.

4) If Highly Relevant: Key reason to read it would be its clear demonstration that condition-specific regulatory variation substantially contributes to disease risk and can reveal effector genes missed by reference catalogs like GTEx, informing strategies for context-aware colocalization and target prioritization.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

2) Why: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated, scalable re-implementation of the colocalisation algorithm designed for millions of traits, demonstrated with UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue data. This directly enables large-scale integration of GWAS and molQTL signals, a core aspect of your workflow for linking variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers.

3) Connections to your research:
- GWAS and PheWAS at scale: supports ultra-fast colocalisation across thousands of traits, enabling comprehensive cross-trait mapping.
- Integration of multi-omics QTLs: explicitly uses molQTL data (eQTL Catalogue) to assess colocalisations, aligning with your aim to connect regulatory elements to phenotypes.
- Colocalization as a bridge to regulatory biology: provides methods/tooling to identify shared causal variants between traits and QTLs, a key step in moving from variants to regulatory mechanisms and potential targets.
- Large-scale analyses and data sources: uses UK Biobank and other large resources, matching your scale and data context.
- Novel metric for large graphs: introduces the colocalisation collider to quantify spurious colocalisations, useful for refining multi-trait networks in PheWAS-like analyses.

4) Key reason to read if Highly Relevant:
- It equips you with a practical, scalable tool to perform cross-trait colocalisation on the scale you require, enabling you to robustly map GWAS signals to molQTLs and regulatory elements across thousands of traits. This can substantially strengthen your pipeline for identifying regulatory mediators and potential drug targets while providing guidance on thresholds to balance sensitivity and specificity in large-scale colocalisation graphs.</div>

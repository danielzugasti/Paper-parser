                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Relevance: Somewhat Relevant

2) Justification: The paper demonstrates context-specific eQTL mapping in stimulated immune cells and shows that stimulus-responsive eQTLs colocalize with GWAS signals, revealing disease effector genes not captured in GTEx. While it advances colocalization and context-specific regulatory insights, it does not present UK Biobank-scale GWAS/PheWAS, multi-omics QTL integration beyond eQTLs, AI/3D-genome perturbation analyses, or direct therapeutic targeting experiments.

3) Connections to your research interests:
- GWAS/PheWAS: Uses colocalization to link regulatory variants to disease at GWAS loci; directly relevant to your goal of connecting variants to disease drivers via regulatory effects.
- Colocalization: Central element; shows added value of reQTL colocalization to nominate disease effector genes.
- Multi-omics QTLs: Limited to expression QTLs (eQTLs) across conditions; no pQTL, meQTL, or other QTL types discussed.
- AI/explainable AI: Not addressed.
- 3D genome: Not addressed.
- Therapeutic targeting: Identifies potential disease effector genes at GWAS loci, including candidates not in GTEx; this informs target prioritization but without experimental perturbation or drug-target analyses.

4) If Highly Relevant, key reason to read it: Not Highly Relevant, but a valuable read for its demonstration that context-specific eQTLs, particularly stimulus-responsive QTLs in immune cells, can substantially increase the number of colocalized disease genes beyond bulk tissue catalogs. This directly informs your approach to incorporating context-specific regulatory information and colocalization in large-scale GWAS/PheWAS analyses and target prioritization.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

2) Brief justification: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated, scalable colocalisation method tested on UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue data. It directly addresses large-scale colocalisation across millions of traits and integrates multi-omics QTL signals, which aligns with your goals of linking genetic variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers at scale.

3) Connections to your research:
- GWAS & multi-omics QTL integration: Uses molQTLs (eQTL Catalogue) and GWAS summary statistics for colocalisation, matching your interest in integrating QTL data with GWAS.
- Large-scale analysis: GPU acceleration enables millions-of-trait level colocalisations, relevant to your scale (2,500 traits) and PheWAS-like breadth.
- Colocalisation methodology and quality control: Introduces the colocalisation collider metric to assess spurious signals, aiding robust target identification.
- Data sources: Incorporates UK Biobank data, which is central to your research framework.

4) If Highly Relevant, key reason to read: It provides a scalable, validated toolset and practical guidelines for performing large-scale colocalisation between GWAS and molQTL signals, with metrics to reduce false positives and explicit use of UKB data—precisely the capabilities you need to strengthen your multi-omics colocalization pipeline and downstream target prioritization.</div>

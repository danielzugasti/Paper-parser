                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Relevance: Somewhat Relevant

2) Justification: The study focuses on context-specific eQTLs (reQTLs) in stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages and their colocalization with GWAS signals, nominating disease effector genes not seen in GTEx. This directly touches on linking regulatory variants to disease drivers via colocalization and highlights tissue/state specificity, which aligns with your integration of QTLs and disease mapping. However, it does not involve UK Biobank-scale GWAS/PheWAS, multi-omics QTLs beyond eQTLs, 3D genome modeling, or in silico therapeutic targeting.

3) Connections to your research:
- GWAS and colocalization: Demonstrates context-specific colocalization to pinpoint disease effector genes at GWAS loci, informing approaches for mapping regulatory variants to disease drivers.
- Context specificity: Highlights that many disease-relevant regulatory effects emerge only in specific cellular states or stimuliâ€”relevant for designing context-aware analyses in large-scale datasets.
- GTEx limitations: Shows that disease signals can be missed in existing catalogs, supporting your aim to expand beyond bulk tissue eQTLs.
- 3D genome/AI/therapeutic targeting: Not directly addressed in this work (no 3D genome analysis, ML/AI perturbations, or drug-target prioritization), so these aspects are only tangentially relevant.

4) If Highly Relevant, key reading reason: N/A (not Highly Relevant per your criteria, but it offers valuable context-specific colocalization insights that could inform your QTL integration strategy).</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

2) Brief justification: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated, scalable colocalisation method that enables ultra-fast testing of shared causal variants across millions of traits using UK Biobank, FinnGen, and molQTL data (eQTL Catalogue). This directly supports large-scale GWAS/multi-omics colocalisation workflows and includes innovations (collider metric) to manage false positives in big datasets, aligning closely with your research goals.

3) Connections to your research:
- Large-scale GWAS/PheWAS integration: Aims to test colocalisation across millions of traits, matching your scale.
- Multi-omics QTL integration: Uses molQTL data (eQTL Catalogue) to link variants to regulatory effects.
- Colocalisation methodology: Builds on CLPP/fine-mapped signalsâ€”relevant to identifying shared causal variants for regulatory elements and diseases.
- Handling of large biobank data: Demonstrates practical workflows with UK Biobank data, directly pertinent to your datasets.
- Quality control in big graphs: Introduces a colocalisation collider metric to assess spurious signals, helpful for prioritizing true regulatory links.
- Applicability even with limited fine-mapping: Shows utility for marginal GWAS when fine mapping is unavailable, broadening use cases for your analyses.

4) If Highly Relevant, key reason to read: It provides a fast, scalable, and validated framework for performing large-scale colocalisation between GWAS and molQTL signals, plus practical guidelines and metrics to discern true regulatory colocalisationsâ€”precisely the kind of tool-and-guidance you need to efficiently link variants to regulatory elements and therapeutic targets across many traits.</div>

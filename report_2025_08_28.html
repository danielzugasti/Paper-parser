                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

- Brief justification: The paper investigates GWAS-colocalization of disease loci with context-specific eQTLs in stimulated macrophages, highlighting how regulatory variation in particular conditions can illuminate disease risk genes. However, it is limited to single-cell–derived gene expression regulation (eQTLs) rather than multi-omics QTLs (eQTL/pQTL/etc.), and it does not address 3D genome organization, AI/perturbation simulations, or large-scale PheWAS.

- Connections to your research:
  - GWAS and colocalization: Directly relevant to linking variants to regulatory effects at disease loci.
  - Context-specific regulation: Supports your interest in condition- or context-dependent regulatory variants that may drive disease.
  - Disease effector genes: Provides examples of identifying genes at GWAS loci that mediate disease risk, which can inform target prioritization.

- If Highly Relevant, key reason to read: N/A (not Highly Relevant). The key value here is context-dependent regulatory insights at disease loci, which can complement broader multi-omics and 3D genome–driven target discovery but does not cover those aspects itself.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

- Brief justification: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated, scalable implementation of genetic colocalisation that can analyze colocalisation across millions of traits using large consortia data (UK Biobank, FinnGen, eQTL Catalogue). This directly supports large-scale GWAS/molQTL integration and robust colocalisation necessary for linking variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers in your research framework.

- Connections to your work:
  - GWAS/PheWAS-scale colocalisation: enables fast testing across thousands/millions of traits, aligning with your large-scale phenotypic analyses.
  - Multi-omics QTL integration: uses molQTL data (eQTLs, etc.) and assesses shared causal variants, matching your aim to connect regulatory elements to diseases.
  - Colocalisation methodology and robustness: introduces a colocalisation collider metric to assess spurious links, improving reliability of large-scale colocalization graphs—valuable for prioritizing targets in your pipeline.
  - Data sources: demonstrates use with UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, directly relevant to your data sources.

- Why you should read it (key takeaway if Highly Relevant): It offers a scalable, near-equivalence to established colocalisation methods but with orders-of-magnitude speed-ups and practical guidelines for handling large-scale colocalisation graphs. This could dramatically accelerate your GWAS/molQTL integration and help you robustly prioritize regulatory mechanisms and target genes across thousands of traits.</div>

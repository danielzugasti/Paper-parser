                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Relevance: Somewhat Relevant

2) Brief justification: The paper investigates context-specific gene expression QTLs (reQTLs) in stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages and uses colocalization with disease GWAS to nominate disease effector genes, including many not found in GTEx. This directly touches regulatory variants and colocalization, which align with your focus on linking genetic variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers. However, it does not cover large-scale UK Biobank GWAS/PheWAS, multi-omics QTLs (beyond eQTLs), 3D genome analyses, or AI-based in silico perturbations.

3) Parts connected to your research:
- GWAS and colocalization: demonstrates how context-specific eQTLs can colocalize with disease loci to nominate causal genes.
- Regulatory elements and disease drivers: highlights regulatory mechanisms and disease effector genes that may be missed in bulk-tissue catalogs.
- Context-specific QTL mapping: supports the importance of cellular context in regulatory variant interpretation.

4) If Highly Relevant, key reason to read: It provides a compelling example that context- and condition-specific regulatory variation can reveal disease-associated genes not visible in standard catalogs, underscoring the need to integrate context-specific QTL data into large-scale GWAS/PheWAS analyses and downstream target prioritization.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

2) Why: The paper introduces gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated implementation of the coloc colocalisation method that enables ultra-fast testing across millions of traits, using large datasets like UK Biobank, FinnGen, and molQTL resources (eQTL Catalogue). This directly supports your core goal of large-scale GWAS/PheWAS with multi-omics QTL integration and colocalization to link variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers.

3) Connects to your research (which parts apply):
- Colocalisation of GWAS and molQTL signals at scale (central to linking variants to regulatory mechanisms).
- Use of UK Biobank and eQTL Catalogue data for colocalisation analyses.
- Scalability and speed, enabling analyses across thousands/millions of traits signals.
- Introduction of the colocalisation collider metric to gauge and control false positives in large colocalisation graphs.
- Applicability to marginal GWAS when fine-mapping is unavailable, broadening the data you can integrate.

4) If you should read it: Yes. Key reason: It provides a practical, scalable tool and methodological advances (GPU-accelerated colocalisation and collider metric) that can significantly enhance your pipeline for multi-omics colocalisation, regulatory element linking, and downstream target prioritization in UKB-based analyses. Note: the paper focuses on colocalisation; it does not address 3D genome modeling or AI-driven perturbation simulations, but it would substantially strengthen the colocalisation step of your workflow.</div>

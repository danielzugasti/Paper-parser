                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Relevance: Somewhat Relevant

2) Why: The paper investigates context-specific regulatory variants (reQTLs) by mapping eQTLs in stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages and demonstrates that these context-specific signals colocalize with GWAS loci, uncovering disease effector genes not captured in GTEx. This aligns with your emphasis on regulatory variants and colocalization, but it does not cover multi-omics QTLs beyond eQTLs, nor AI/3D genome analyses or large-scale PheWAS.

3) Connections to your research
- Context-specific QTLs: demonstrates that regulatory effects can be revealed only under certain cellular conditions, relevant to designing context-aware GWAS/PheWAS analyses.
- Colocalization with GWAS: directly pertains to linking regulatory variants to disease drivers, a core aspect of your integrative approach.
- Discovery beyond GTEx: shows that disease-associated regulatory mechanisms can be missed in reference datasets, highlighting the value of diverse contexts in QTL mapping.
- Potential method insights: supports applying colocalization to condition-specific QTLs and could inspire expansion to multi-omics QTLs (eQTLs, pQTLs, etc.) in disease contexts.

4) If you decide to read it: Key reason
- Read this to gain insights into how context-specific regulatory variation (reQTLs) enhances disease gene mapping and to consider incorporating stimulated-condition QTL designs and context-aware colocalization into your large-scale GWAS/PheWAS and multi-omics integration framework. Note that you may need to complement with studies that address multi-omics QTLs, 3D genome architecture, and AI-driven perturbation analyses for a closer fit to your broader goals.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

2) Brief justification: The paper delivers gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated implementation of colocalisation that enables large-scale testing across millions of traits using UK Biobank, FinnGen, and molQTL data. This directly supports your goals of integrating expansive GWAS with multi-omics QTLs and conducting scalable colocalisation analyses.

3) Connecting elements to your research:
- GWAS and multi-omics QTL integration: Focuses on colocalisation between GWAS/molQTL signals, enabling linkage of variants to regulatory effects and potential disease drivers.
- Large-scale scope: Specifically designed for millions of traits and signals, aligning with your ~2,500-trait, large-cohort ambitions.
- UK Biobank and molQTL data: Uses UKB summary stats and eQTL Catalogue, matching the data types you work with.
- Methodological rigor for large-scale colocalisation: Introduces a colocalisation collider metric to manage spurious results and provides practical guidelines for thresholding in big graphs.
- Speed and practicality: GPU acceleration promises substantial runtime improvements, facilitating iterative analyses and integration steps in your pipeline.

4) If Highly Relevant, key reason to read: It provides a scalable, validated tool (gpu-coloc) and actionable guidelines for conducting large-scale colocalisation between GWAS and molQTL signals, a foundational step for mapping regulatory variants to genes and pathways in your multi-omics and 3D-genome-informed target discovery workflow. This could substantially accelerate and improve the robustness of your colocalization analyses across thousands of traits.</div>

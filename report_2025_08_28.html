                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Somewhat Relevant

2) Justification: The paper investigates context-specific regulatory variation by mapping eQTLs in stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages and uses colocalization with GWAS signals to nominate disease effector genes—including many not present in GTEx. This directly informs how regulatory variants in specific contexts contribute to complex diseases, aligning with your interest in colocalization and regulatory mechanisms. However, it does not cover large-scale GWAS/PheWAS across thousands of traits, multi-omics QTL integration (eQTLs, pQTLs, etc.), 3D genome modeling, or AI-based in silico perturbations for target prioritization.

3) Connections to your research focus:
- GWAS colocalization: uses colocalization to link regulatory variants to disease risk loci.
- Context-specific regulation: demonstrates significant role of condition/stimulus-specific eQTLs (reQTLs) in disease associations.
- Disease mechanism inference: identifies disease effector genes at GWAS loci, including genes not captured in GTEx, informing regulatory element–disease links.

4) If it were Highly Relevant: Key reason to read would be its demonstration that condition-specific regulatory variants (reQTLs) can reveal disease drivers at GWAS loci that are missed in static reference datasets, highlighting the importance of context in regulatory genomics for target discovery.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

2) Brief justification: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated, scalable approach to colocalisation using UK Biobank, FinnGen, and molQTL data, addressing the need to test millions of trait-signal pairs. It directly enables large-scale colocalisation analyses to link genetic variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers, a core aspect of your integration of multi-omics QTLs with GWAS/PheWAS.

3) Connections to your work:
- Colocalisation across large trait sets (aligns with your large-scale GWAS/PheWAS and multi-omics integration)
- Use of molQTLs (eQTLs, pQTLs) and summary statistics to identify shared causal variants
- Scalability and practical guidelines for large-scale colocalisation analyses (important for processing ~2,500 traits)
- Provides a method to prioritize variants/ loci for downstream interpretation (e.g., regulatory elements and potential targets)

Not directly addressing:
- 3D genome organization (loops, TADs, spatial nodes) or in silico perturbation/therapeutic targeting via AI; no explicit ML explainability or 3D-genome perturbation simulation

4) If highly relevant, key reason to read: It offers a fast, scalable framework for robust colocalisation across millions of trait signals with molQTL data, including a novel collider metric to reduce spurious results, which is central to reliably linking regulatory variants to diseases at the scale you pursue. This method could be foundational for your colocalisation step before downstream multi-omics integration and target prioritization.</div>

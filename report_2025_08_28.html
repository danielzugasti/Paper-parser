                    <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                        <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Relevance: Highly Relevant

2) Justification: The paper demonstrates context-specific eQTLs (reQTLs) in stimulated immune cells and shows that these regulatory effects systematically colocalize with disease GWAS signals, revealing disease effector genes—including many not found in GTEx. This directly informs how to link genetic variants to regulatory mechanisms and disease drivers in a context-relevant (immune) setting, aligning with your GWAS/PheWAS and colocalization-focused workflow.

3) Connections to your research:
- GWAS/PheWAS and colocalization: Uses colocalization to map disease loci to regulatory variants, directly relevant to linking variants to phenotypes.
- Multi-omics QTL integration: Provides a context-specific eQTL framework; while primarily eQTL-focused, it offers a blueprint for integrating regulatory effects with disease traits and could be extended to other QTL types (eQTL, pQTL) in multi-omics analyses.
- 3D genome and regulatory networks: While not addressing 3D genome organization, the work highlights context-dependent regulation that could be connected to chromatin interaction data in future analyses to prioritize regulatory nodes.
- Therapeutic targeting: Identifies disease effector genes at GWAS loci, including genes absent from GTEx catalogs—a valuable source for potential drug targets and pathway prioritization.

4) If Highly Relevant, key reason to read: It provides a compelling, context-specific approach to map regulatory effects to disease risk via colocalization, expanding beyond bulk-tissue eQTL catalogs and uncovering novel disease effector genes—a core need in your target pipeline for identifying actionable targets in immune-related diseases.</div>

                    <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

                        <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1. Highly Relevant

2. Brief justification: The paper introduces gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated colocalisation method enabling large-scale testing of shared causal variants across millions of traits using UK Biobank and molQTL data. This directly supports your goals of large-scale GWAS/PheWAS integration with colocalisation to link variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers.

3. Connecting parts to your research:
- GWAS/PheWAS scale analyses: scalable colocalisation across many traits.
- Integration with molQTLs (eQTLs, pQTLs): uses eQTL Catalogue and other molQTL resources to map signals to regulatory biology.
- Colocalisation methodology: near-identical results to established methods with a new collider metric to assess spurious signals, helpful for robust target prioritization.
- Practical workflow: demonstrates application to real biobank data (UKB, FinnGen), which aligns with your data sources and analysis scale.

4. Key reason to read it: It provides a practical, scalable tool and methodology to perform large-scale colocalisation across millions of trait signals, which could dramatically accelerate your pipeline for linking genetic variants to regulatory mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, while offering metrics to interpret complex colocalisation graphs.</div>

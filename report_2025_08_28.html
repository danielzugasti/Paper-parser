                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

2) Justification: The paper demonstrates context-specific regulatory variation (reQTLs) in stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages and uses colocalization to link these regulatory signals to disease risk loci, including loci not captured in GTEx. This aligns with your interest in context-specific QTLs and colocalization to identify disease drivers, though it focuses on eQTLs in a specific cell type/condition and does not cover multi-omics QTLs, large-scale UK Biobank data, or 3D genome/AI-based perturbation analyses.

3) Connections to your research interests:
- Context-specific regulatory QTLs: relevance to capturing regulatory effects that may be missed in bulk or static eQTL maps.
- Colocalization with disease loci: directly pertinent to linking variants to regulatory elements and potential disease drivers.
- Discovery beyond GTEx: expands the resource base for interpreting GWAS signals beyond existing catalogs.
- Immune cell context: provides insights potentially translatable to immune-related diseases you study in large-scale GWAS/PheWAS.

4) If youâ€™re considering reading it: A key takeaway is how context-specific regulatory variation (in stimulated immune cells) can uncover disease-associated regulatory mechanisms and identify additional disease effector genes beyond GTEx, which could inform design choices for context-rich QTL integration in GWAS analyses.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

- Why: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated, scalable method for colocalisation across millions of traits using large biobank and molQTL summary statistics (including UK Biobank and eQTL Catalogue). This directly aligns with your focus on large-scale GWAS/PheWAS, integration of molQTLs with colocalisation to link variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers, and the need to manage false positives in big colocalisation graphs (collider metric). It also demonstrates applicability to studies that lack fine mapping, which is valuable for broad, multi-trait analyses.

- Which parts connect to your research:
  - GWAS/MolQTL colocalisation at scale: Enables large-scale testing of shared causal variants between complex traits and molQTLs, essential for your multi-trait projects.
  - Integration with regulatory elements: Colocalisation with eQTLs/molQTLs helps map variants to regulatory effects and potential disease drivers.
  - Handling of large-scale graphs and false positives: The colocalisation collider metric is relevant for constructing robust regulatory networks and prioritizing targets.
  - UKB and multi-cohort data usage: Demonstrates feasibility and performance on UK Biobank and other large biobanks, matching the data scale you work with.

- If you should read it: Key reason is that this method dramatically lowers the computational barrier to performing comprehensive, cross-trait colocalisation analyses at the scale you require, enabling you to systematically link variants to regulatory elements and infer potential disease drivers across thousands of traits with greater speed and reliability.</div>

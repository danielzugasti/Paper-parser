                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1. Relevance: Somewhat Relevant

2. Brief justification: The paper investigates context-specific eQTLs by mapping them in stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages and shows that such reQTLs colocalize with disease GWAS signals, including many not found in GTEx. While this aligns with your focus on GWAS/colocalization and linking variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers, it does not address PheWAS, multi-omics QTLs (eQTL/pQTL/etc.), 3D genome topology, or AI-driven perturbation modeling.

3. Connections to your research:
- GWAS and colocalization: demonstrates how context-specific regulatory variation can illuminate disease-associated loci.
- Linking variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers: identifies disease effector genes via colocalization, expanding beyond bulk-tissue catalogs like GTEx.
- Context-specific regulatory mechanisms: highlights the importance of cellular context (stimulated states) in interpreting regulatory variants.

4. If you still want a primary takeaway: This paper is not Highly Relevant, but reading it could inform your pipeline by illustrating the value of context-specific eQTL mapping and advanced colocalization to identify disease-relevant regulatory genes that GTEx may miss, which could enhance your target prioritization in GWAS/PheWAS analyses.</div>

                            <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

                                <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Highly Relevant

2) Brief justification: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated colocalisation method that enables large-scale testing across millions of traits using UK Biobank, FinnGen, and molQTL data (eQTL Catalogue). This directly supports rapid integration of GWAS/PheWAS signals with multi-omics QTLs to identify shared causal variants and regulatory drivers.

3) Connects to your research:
- GWAS/PheWAS scale: designed for massively parallel colocalisation across many traits.
- Multi-omics QTL integration: uses eQTL data and other molQTL signals to inform colocalisation.
- Colocalization methodology: provides a scalable way to link variants to regulatory elements and disease drivers.
- Tools for large datasets: GPU acceleration and handling of fine-mapped vs non-fine-mapped signals align with your large-scale data workflows.
- UK Biobank relevance: uses UKB data, matching your resource base.

4) If highly relevant, key reason to read: It offers a practical, scalable solution to perform comprehensive colocalisation analyses across vast trait spaces and QTL catalogs, with metrics (colocalisation collider) to manage false positives and guidance for analyses lacking fine mapping—all critical for your aim of connecting regulatory architecture to human phenotypes at scale.

Note: It does not address 3D genome perturbations or AI-driven in silico perturbation of chromatin directly, so those aspects of your research would need complementary papers or methods.</div>

                    <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing catalogues of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We hypothesise that these variants may regulate expression in specific biological contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular conditions. We found that 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across conditions (3.7% - 28.4%), with reQTLs specific to a single condition being rare (1.11%). Despite their relative rarity, reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We nominated an additional 21.7% of disease effector genes at GWAS loci via colocalization of reQTLs, with 38.6% of these not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalogue. Our study highlights the diversity of genetic effects on expression and demonstrates how condition-specific regulatory variation can enhance our understanding of common disease risk alleles.</div>

                        <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Overall relevance: Somewhat Relevant

2) Brief justification: The study maps context-specific eQTLs in stimulated immune cells and uses colocalization with GWAS to identify disease effector genes, illustrating how regulatory variation in specific contexts can illuminate disease biology. However, it does not cover PheWAS, multi-omics QTLs beyond eQTLs, AI/3D genome perturbations, or explicit therapeutic targeting, limiting its direct alignment with all aspects of your program.

3) Connections to your research:
- GWAS and colocalization: Direct relevance; demonstrates context-specific regulatory variants that colocalize with disease loci.
- PheWAS: Not addressed.
- Multi-omics QTLs: Limited to eQTLs (no pQTLs or other QTL types), so partial relevance.
- AI / explainable AI / in silico perturbations of the 3D genome: Not present.
- 3D genome / chromatin architecture: Not addressed.
- Therapeutic targeting: Identifies disease effector genes at GWAS loci (not framed as drug targets or perturbation-based targets), offering some downstream relevance but not core to target discovery or AI-driven perturbations.

4) If highly relevant, key reading takeaway would be: Not applicable, as this is not classified as Highly Relevant. If your goal is to understand how context-specific regulatory variation affects GWAS signals and to refine colocalization-based gene prioritization, this paper provides a useful methodological example and expands the catalog of disease-associated regulatory effects beyond bulk-tissue atlases.</div>

                    <div class="authors"><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Jesse, A.-E. Riet, K. Alasoo</div>

                    <div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Colocalisation is a powerful approach to assess if two genetic association signals are likely to share a causal variant. However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci. Our efficient software and comprehensive analyses provide practical guidelines for future large-scale colocalisation analyses.</div>

                        <div><strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> 1) Relevance classification: Highly Relevant

2) Why: The paper presents gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc colocalisation method that enables ultra-fast, large-scale colocalisation analyses across millions of traits using summary statistics from resources like UK Biobank, FinnGen, and molQTL datasets. This directly supports your goals of large-scale GWAS/PheWAS, integration with multi-omics QTLs, and prioritizing regulatory variants and disease drivers.

3) Connections to your research:
- Colocalisation methodology at scale: directly aligns with integrating GWAS signals with molQTLs to link variants to regulatory elements and genes.
- Large-scale data usage: designed for millions of traits and large biobank datasets (e.g., UK Biobank), matching your scale.
- Integration with molQTLs and multi-omics: uses eQTL data and other molQTLs to infer shared causal variants.
- Handling of fine-mapped vs marginal signals: useful when some traits lack fine mapping, broadening applicability to diverse datasets.
- Quality control/interpretation: introduces the colocalisation collider metric to assess and threshold potential false positives in large colocalisation graphs, aiding robust network construction.

4) Key reason to read it (if Highly Relevant): It provides a scalable, practical tool for performing large-scale colocalisation analyses across thousands/millions of traits, which is central to your pipeline for linking genetic variation to regulatory mechanisms and disease drivers. It can substantially accelerate your GWAS/PheWAS + molQTL integration and improve reliability of inferred target genes before downstream 3D genome integration or AI-driven perturbation analyses.</div>
